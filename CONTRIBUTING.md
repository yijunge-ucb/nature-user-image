# How to contribute and make changes to your user image

## Setting up your fork and clones
First, go to your [GitHub profile settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
and make sure you have an SSH key uploaded.

Next, go to the GitHub repo of the image that you'd like to work on and create
a fork.  To do this, click on the `fork` button and then `Create fork`.

After you create your fork of the new image repository, you should disable
GitHub Actions **only for your fork**.  To do this, navigate to `Settings` -->
`Actions` --> `General` and select `Disable actions`.  Then click `Save`:

![Disable fork actions](images/disable-fork-actions.png)

Now clone the primary image repo on your local device.  You can get the URL to do
this by clicking on the green `Code` button in the primary image repo (*not* your fork)
and clicking on `SSH` and copying the text located therein:

![Remote](images/remote.png)

Now `cd` in to a handy folder on your device, and clone the primary repo by
running the following command (replace `<image-name>` with the actual name
of the image):

```
git clone git@github.com:berkeley-dsep-infra/<image-name>.git
```

Now `cd` in to `<image-name>` and set up your local repo to point both at the primary
image repo (`upstream`) and your fork (`origin`).  After the initial clone,
`origin` will be pointing to the main repo and we'll need to change that.

```
cd <image-name>
git remote rename origin upstream # rename origin to upstream
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your github username>/<image-name>.git # add your fork as origin
```

To confirm these changes, run `git remote -v` and see if everything is correct:
```
$ cd <image-name>
$ git remote -v # confirm the settings
origin	git@github.com:<your github username>/<image-name>.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:<your github username>/<image-name>.git (push)
upstream	git@github.com:berkeley-dsep-infra/<image-name>.git (fetch)
upstream	git@github.com:berkeley-dsep-infra/<image-name>.git (push)
```

Now you can sync your local repo from `upstream`, and push those changes to your
fork (`origin`):

```
git checkout main && \
git fetch --prune --all && \
git rebase upstream/main && \
git push origin main
```

## Procedure for making changes to the image

### High-level overview of the full process

stateDiagram-v2
    image_repo: github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/hubname-user-image
    user_repo: github.com/username/hubname-user-image
    image_test_build: Image is built and tested
    image_push_build: Image is built and pushed to registry
    pr_created: A pull request is automatically<br/>created in the Datahub repo
    deploy_to_staging: Hub is deployed to staging
    contributor_tests: The contributor logs into the<br/>staging hub and tests the image.
    deploy_to_prod: Hub is deployed to prod

    image_repo --> user_repo: Contributor forks the image repo.
    user_repo --> image_repo: Contributor creates a PR.
    image_repo --> image_test_build
    image_test_build --> image_push_build: Test build passes and Datahub staff merge pull request
    image_push_build --> pr_created
    pr_created --> deploy_to_staging: Datahub staff review and merge to staging
    deploy_to_staging --> contributor_tests
    contributor_tests --> deploy_to_prod: Datahub staff create a PR to merge to prod
```

These steps will be explained in detail below.

### Syncing your repository before you make any changes

When developing for this deployment, always work in a fork of this repo.
You should also make sure that your repo is up-to-date with this one prior
to making changes. This is because other contributors may have pushed changes
after you last synced with this repo but before you upstreamed your changes.

```
git checkout main && \
git fetch --prune --all && \
git rebase upstream/main && \
git push origin main
```

To create a new feature branch and switch to it, run the following command:

```
git checkout -b <branch name>
```

After you make your changes, you can use the following commands to see
what's been modified and check out the diffs:  `git status` and `git diff`.

### Building the image locally

You need to use [repo2docker](https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to
build and use/test the image on your own device before you push and create a
pull request. It's better (and typically faster) to do this first before using
CI/CD.  There's no need to waste GitHub Action minutes to test build images
when you can do this on your own device!

Run `repo2docker` from inside the cloned image repo.  To run on a linux/WSL2
or regular linux shell:
```
repo2docker . # <--- the path to the repo
```

If you are using an ARM CPU (Apple M* silicon), you will need to run
`jupyter-repo2docker` with the following arguments:

```
jupyter-repo2docker --user-id=1000 --user-name=jovyan \
  --Repo2Docker.platform=linux/amd64 \
  --target-repo-dir=/home/jovyan/.cache \
  -e PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/srv/conda \
  . # <--- the path to the repo
```

If you just want to see if the image builds, but not automatically launch the
server, add `--no-run` to the arguments (before the final `.`).

### Pushing the modified files to your fork

When you're ready to push these changes, first you'll need to stage them for a
commit:

```
git add <file1> <file2> ...
```

Commit these changes locally:

```
git commit -m "some pithy commit description"
```

Now push to your fork:

```
git push origin <branch name>
```

### Creating a pull request

Once you've pushed to your fork, you can go to the image repo and there should
be a big green button on the top that says `Compare and pull request`.
Click on that, check out the commits and file diffs, edit the title and
description if needed and then click `Create pull request`.

![Compare and create PR](images/compare-and-create-pr.png)

![Create PR](images/create-pr.png)

If you're having issues, you can refer to the [GitHub documentation for pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
Keep the choice for `base` in the GitHub PR user interface, while the choice
for `head` is your fork.

Once this is complete and if there are no problems, a GitHub action will
automatically [build and test](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/hub-user-image-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-test-image.yaml)
the image.  If this fails, please check the output of the workflow in the
action, and make any changes required to get the build to pass.

### Code reviews and merging the pull request

Once the image build has completed successfully, you can request that
someone review the PR before merging, or you can merge yourself if you are
confident. This merge will trigger a [second giuthub workflow](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/hub-user-image-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-push-create-pr.yaml)
that builds the image again, pushes it to the appropriate location in our
Google Artifact Registry and finally creates a pull request in the
[Datahub](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub). This pull request
updates the hash used to identify the freshly built image.

### Pull request review in the Datahub repository

Let the Datahub staff know that the pull request was created, and they will
review and merge it into the `staging` branch. You can notify them via a
corresponding GitHub Issue, or on the UCTech #datahubs slack channel.

Once it's been merged to `staging`, it will automatically deploy the new image
to the hub's staging environment in a few minutes and you'll be able to test it
out!

When you're happy with the results, let Datahub staff know, and they will
create another pull request to deploy the new image to `prod`.
